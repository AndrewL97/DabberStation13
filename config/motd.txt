Rules :
0. RP is not required at all, since most of the game is about working and doing your stuff, stories aren't really required. You're allowed to talk about anything in IC/OOC.
1. No ERP/NSFW content in any type of chat.
2. The only crime here is not being funny. We all deserve a good laugh sometimes!
3. If you get banned, you've really annoyed us and don't expect to get unbanned.
