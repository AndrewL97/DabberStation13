# Dabber Station 13 - Space Station 13 Server
Active build for Dab13 codebase, what is dab13?
Dab13 is a space station 13 game which tries to aim more to be fun, and not focus that much on the roleplay, can be considered a LRP game. It includes TTS, water simulation, height simulation (jumping!), a epic gun system, animations (your spacemans are now dancing), particles, etc.

Being honest it's one of the worst works i've ever made tbh.
