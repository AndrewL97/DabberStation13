# Dabber Station 13 - Space Station 13 Server
Active build for Dab13 codebase, what is dab13?
Dab13 is a space station 13 server (Based off old Goonstation R4407, but heavily edited), which tries to aim more to be fun, and not focus that much on the roleplay, can be considered a LRP game. It includes TTS, water simulation, height simulation (jumping!), "robust guns" as the players call it, sandbox, fun, animations (your spacemans are now dancing), particles, etc.
