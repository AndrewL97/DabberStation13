# dab13
Active build for Dab13 codebase.

You need to edit admin_verbs to change admins. And you need to create a webhook.txt file and webhookAdmin.txt file in the config folder, These are used for the discord webhooks. webhook.txt is a webhook that logs player chat, and webhookAdmin.txt is a adminhelp webhook. It's broken though.
